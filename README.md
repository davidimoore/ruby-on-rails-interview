## Ruby on Rails Technical Interview

 ### Setup Steps
 1. pull repo
 2. docker-compose up
 3. in a seperate terminal run `bin/terminal`
 4. once you have an interactive terminal session run `bin/setup`

 After completing the setup steps you can see in the `db/seeds.rb` file that two users are created:
 1. an admin
 2. a regular user.

 This app also comes with `devise` already added for authentication.
